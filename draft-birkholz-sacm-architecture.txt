1.  Introduction

   Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring is conducted in a SACM
   domain.  This document defines the architectural components and
   corresponding roles a SACM Domain is composed of.  The goal is to
   enable interoperability between standard SACM Components and a
   minimal level of automated orchestration that is always supported in
   a SACM Domain.

   In consequence, this document also provides the reference terminology
   vital to security automation or related to network-based remote
   assessment of security posture.  Terms defined or referenced by the
   SACM Architecture document are either not covered in or derived from
   RFC4949, or show an impedance mismatch across existing standards and
   are unified via this document for future application in the domain of
   security automation.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119, BCP 14 [RFC2119].

2.  Roles in SACM

   The architectural building blocks a SACM Domain is composed of are
   very modular.  There are three tiers of roles that facilitate this
   modular composability.

2.1.  Base Roles

   Every endpoint that is part of a SACM Domain MUST take on at least
   one of the following roles:

   o  Either Target Endpoint or Excluded Endpoint, or

   o  SACM Component.

   Target Endpoints are the endpoints of interest in a SACM Domain.
   Ultimately, these endpoints are monitored continuously in order to
   enable security posture assessment, compliance assessment and
   eventually remediation or mitigation of violations to security
   requirements in a SACM Domain.  If an endpoint that is part of the
   SACM Domain, is not a SACM Component and is not to be monitored, it
   MUST take on the role of Excluded Endpoint.

   SACM Components facilitate every activity conducted in a SACM Domain
   that enable security posture assessment via specific functions, such
   as the collection (of measured or otherwise acquired endpoint
   attributes) from data sources, the conveyance of annotated statements
   about security posture, or the assessment via imperative and
   declarative guidance.

   An endpoint MAY take on both the role of a Target Endpoint and a SACM
   Component.  In this case, information produced is fed directly into
   the SACM Domain by a software agent (that is a SACM Component)
   residing on the Target Endpoint without the indirection of a
   collecting SACM Component.

2.2.  SACM Component Roles

   Every SACM Component MAY incorporate functions that either produce
   information on the data-plane or consume information on the data-
   plane.  The corresponding two roles a SACM Component can take on are:

   o  Consumer of Information (in short: Consumer or Subscriber), and

   o  Provider of Information (in short: Provider or Publisher).

   A SACM Component MAY take on both roles at once, for example,
   consuming information via one set of functions, processing them
   internally, and then providing the results via another set of
   functions.

   On the control-plane, every SACM Component MUST incorporate functions
   that enable it to take on the role of an:

   o  Applicant, or

   o  Broker.

   All activities of SACM components in a SACM domain MUST be
   orchestrated.  Orchestration is facilitated by conveying imperative
   guidance between Applicants and Brokers.  Every Applicant MUST
   register the functions it is designed to expose to the SACM Domain as
   Capabilities to a Broker.  A Broker MUST make the set of registered
   Capabilities (or a well-defined subset) available to other
   Applicants.

   The set of Capabilities made available by a Broker SHOULD be
   restricted by a Content Authorization function incorporated in
   Brokers.

2.3.  SACM Function Roles

   Every function incorporated in a SACM Component MUST support the flow
   information and corresponding processing of information in a SACM
   Domain.  There is no finite list of SACM Functions, but there is a
   well known set of functions for the control-plane and the management-
   plane:

   o  Registration Applicant and Applicant Registrar

   o  Collection Guidance Provider and Collection Guidance Consumer

   o  etc.pp.  Note: Is this the correct level of detail or do we want
      "Collector" and "Assessor" here?
