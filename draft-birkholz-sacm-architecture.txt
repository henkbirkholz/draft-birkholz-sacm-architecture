1.  Introduction

   Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring is conducted in a SACM
   domain.  This document defines the architectural components and
   corresponding roles a SACM Domain is composed of.  The goal is to
   enable interoperability between standard SACM Components and a
   minimal level of automated orchestration that is always supported in
   a SACM Domain.

   In consequence, this document also provides the reference terminology
   vital to security automation or related to network-based remote
   assessment of security posture.  Terms defined or referenced by the
   SACM Architecture document are either not covered in or derived from
   RFC4949, or show an impedance mismatch across existing standards and
   are unified via this document for future application in the domain of
   security automation.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119, BCP 14 [RFC2119].

2.  Roles in SACM

   The architectural building blocks a SACM domain is composed of are
   very modular.  There are three tiers of roles that facilitate this
   modular composability.

2.1.  Base Roles

   Every endpoint that is part of a SACM domain can take one or two of
   the following base roles:

   o  Target Endpoint, and

   o  SACM Component.

   Target Endpoints are the endpoints of interest a SACM domain.
   Ultimately, these endpoints are monitored continuously in order to
   enable security posture assessment, compliance assessment and
   eventually remediation or mitigation of violations to security
   requirements in a SACM Domain.

   SACM Components facilitate every activity conducted in a SACM domain,
   such as collection (of measured or acuirelife data), the conveyance

   SACM component roles:

   SACM function roles:

   This document may include requests to IANA some day.
